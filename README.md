You can upload statistics for different regions and view useful data from year to year. 

Some interesting tasks by my opinion witch i resolved:

	* Collect data of the population, unemployment rate, GDP and education. 
	* To develop visualization such as graphs, maps, tables. 
	* Adding filters to solve deep analysis problems.    
	* Add a tool to compare different regions among themselves and how they change over time.
